# Including the ball in a radar view for a soccer game video

This is contribution coming after this great repo  https://github.com/roboflow/sports/blob/main/examples/soccer/main.py
Special problems occurs when the ball is not on the ground as homography assume objects are in a plane.

The proposed solution includes various techniques (ML, signal processing).
A video with the radar view including the ball is availble here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJvpVmD1kMLt1hgrkiUTy1bgqHvTp-e8/view?usp=sharing (the ball is the yellow dot)
